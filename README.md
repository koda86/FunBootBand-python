Python Port of this Repository (Originally in R): https://github.com/koda86/FunBootBand

DISCLAIMER: This is a functional working version; however, it has not undergone extensive testing. Please be aware that entering the construction site is at your own risk.

To run the current version, run test_FunBootBand.py. The script should be self-explanatory (at least I hope so).
